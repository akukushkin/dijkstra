Programm is finding the sortest path and distance between two vertexes
directed weighted graph with using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Input data:
1) text file with graph in format .xgml;
2) starting vertex;
3) target vertex.

Output data:
1) shortest distance between two vertexes;
2) shortest path between two vertexes.
Note: If path is not found printed message "Path doesn't exists.".
