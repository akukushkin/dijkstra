# Dijkstra's algorithm.
Programm is finding the sortest path and distance between two vertexes
directed weighted graph with using Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Input data:
* text file with graph in format .xgml
* starting vertex
* target vertex

### Output data:
* shortest distance between two vertexes
* shortest path between two vertexes

Note: If path is not found printed message "Path doesn't exists.".

### Working enviroment:

 * Qt Creator 3.0.1 based on Qt 5.2.1
 * gcc version 4.9.2 (Ubuntu 4.9.2-0ubuntu1~14.04)
 * Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
